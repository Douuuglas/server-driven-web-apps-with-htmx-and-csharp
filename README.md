# Chapter 01
The first chapter has two simple projects which I implemented in a single one. I'm using C# minimal API for serving the requests/static assets and Razor as the HTML template.
    
- Minimal API has the advantage of being really easy to implement and requires quite little code.
    
- Razor as the HTML engine is really powerfull because it allows me to split code into components that can be used in other places and it's statically typed which makes my life way easier.
